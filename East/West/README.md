You stand at a clearing, in which is a beautiful fountain. The sound of it is soothing, and the water is crystal clear. 
Actually, at the bottom of the fountain, you see some rocks! Not just any rocks, they look awfully similar to one you've seen before, and maybe brought with you! They also have messages engraved on them.

1. Type `ls` to see the contents of this directory, and read the message on the rocks.
2. You should now know what the next area to go to is.
3. `cd` into the next area.
4. `cat README.md` once in the new folder to continue.
