You enter the pathway and turn the corner, and find yourself staring at a brick wall.
Bad luck - this wasn't the correct location.
The instructions said "If your last two steps taken were East, South, then go to the direction (folder) labelled `ES`. If it's West, South, then go to the direction (folder) labelled `WS`."
If you ran `pwd` in that folder, it should have ended in `/West/South`, indicating you should have gone to the `WS` folder.
If you run `pwd` now, it should end in `/ES` - meaning you went to the wrong folder.
If any of that doesn't sound like it lines up, then maybe some files and folders in this adventure got accidentally moved somehow. In that case, try re-downloading the entire zip and starting again.
Otherwise, type `cd ..` to go backwards and try again.
