You deciphered the helpful clues, and went in the correct direction!
But now you stand at a crossroads. 
A helpful sign says "If your last two steps taken were East, South, then go to the direction (folder) labelled `ES`. If it's West, South, then go to the direction (folder) labelled `WS`."

Two paths await, labelled `ES` and `WS`.
You could try and remember the last two directions you went in to get here, but let's not leave it to chance.
Let's use the command to show us the current directory we're in!
Type `pwd` to see the current directory you're in. 
It will end in either `/East/South` or `/West/South`. Use that knowledge to take the correct choice at this fork.
Then, as always, `cd` into the next area and `cat README.md` to continue.

So:
1. `pwd` to see your current location
2. `ls` to see the files and folders in your current location, to review your options
3. `cd` into the folder you think you should enter
4. `cat README.md` inside your new folder to continue
