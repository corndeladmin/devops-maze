You proceed North, turn a corner and stop dead in your tracks. Below you, the ground ends, giving way to a dark, impossibly deep pit in the ground.
This was not the correct way.
Running `ls` in the previous directory should have revealed a message in the filenames:
```
1-YOU
2-REALLY
3-SHOULD
4-NOT
5-GO
6-NORTH
```
In other words, you should have gone South, not North.
If you're still not sure how you ended up here, it's possible that some files and folders in this adventure got accidentally moved somehow. In that case, try re-downloading the entire zip and starting again.
Otherwise, go back up by entering `cd ..` and try again.
