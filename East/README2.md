Well done!

Did you see it? The thing that wasn't the README files?

It's a file called `4-NOT`. That's the rock. We want to continue going forward, following this passage around a bend to the West, but we want to take the potentially useful rock with us to the next area. 

This is your flimsy narrative pretext for needing to move a file in the CLI. We're going West, so we need to move that file into the West folder. There are actually two ways to do this:

- `mv 4-NOT West/`
- `mv 4-NOT West/4-NOT` 

The first one is the shortest, so you might as well do that.

After you've moved the file to the West folder, we'll want to check that the operation went as expected. We can do that by looking around the next area to confirm it's there, but for now just do another `ls` to confirm the rock is no longer here.

After that, `cd West` to continue.
