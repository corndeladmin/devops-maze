You continue along a passage, the hedges running ever taller alongside you. 

While walking along, you spot an item on the ground - a strange rock, with some writing carved into it. 

Type `ls` to look at the contents of this directory, and you'll see it. Then you'll also see the second part of the description, called `README2.md`. You'll want to display that afterwards by doing `cat README2.md`

Got it? You're doing two things:
1. `ls` (to look around you)
2. `cat README2.md` (to see the next half of the instructions)
