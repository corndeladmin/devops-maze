This is a CLI practice exercise in the form of a text adventure.

The learning objective is to quickly get you used to and comfortable with performing essential CLI commands. By the end, you shouldn't need to look up the basic commands to use them; you should have built up some working muscle memory for them instead. We do this by necessitating their repeated use to solve a problem.

That problem is: escape the area (of the text adventure) by finding a secret key (in the text adventure).

Each folder is an area. This is the start point.

Each area (folder) contains a description file (`README.md`). This file is the description for the starting area.

Each description will explain what's going on and what you need to do next. Eventually, you'll find the secret key.

If you're already confident in your CLI skills, you can probably devise a shortcut to immediately finding the key yourself! But if not, let's get started.

---

You are in a garden. A vast one - or perhaps more like a large hedge maze, given the dense and well kept but tall walls of bushes that surround you.

There are exits to the North and East.

Correspondingly, there is a folder called North and a folder called East. You will want to change directory to them, then read the README.

Try going North first. You can do this by doing `cd North` then `cat README.md`.
Or if you've already gone North, try East.
